#This file is to support a study during design stage
#This use case needs to know different HDL and total cholesterol units

#We assume a site has executed latest version of Achilles
#if you do not have Achilles results, uncomment and execute a ACHILLES_PART below


#The setup is EXACTLY the same as for the prediction package, taken from 
#https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/RCRI/blob/master/extras/CodeToRun.R
#just the top few lines, cut and paste it from your prior executions
